All the scripts have their commands commented out at the end of their respected scripts.

Usage of knn.py:
main(valuesOfK,kFoldAMount)
test(BestKValue)
Example usage:
main(200,10), where 200 is the maximum k value (k=1,2,3...100 will be tried in our case), and 10 is the folding amount(used in the cross validation). This functin outputs the plot as knn_graph.png
test(11), where 11 is the best value of k to test the test data

Usage of kmeans.py:
main(tryNTimes)
plots()
Example usage:
main(10), where 10 is the number of tries to decide for the lowest objective function for the corresponding k value. k=1,2,...10 are tried and is hardcoded inside script.
plots(), will plot the data and save it in the following way: str(i+1)+'th_kmeans_graph.png' where "i+1" is the ith data.

Usage of hac.py:
main(): automatically does the computations demanded in the homework and saves the plots. Plots are named data_names[i]+"_"+criterion_names[j]+'.png'.
