My files for first and second parts respectively: decision.py and svm.py

For the decision tree (first) part:
Uncomment the bottom-most "main()" function in the decision.py file to run the code.

I commented below lines in the main() function:
gra1.render('info_gain_preprune.pdf')
gra2.render('info_gain_no_preprune.pdf')
gra3.render('avg_gini_index_preprune.pdf')
gra4.render('avg_gini_index_no_preprune.pdf')
Uncommenting them in the main function results in drawing the trees also, or only the prediction results would show up.
The function "main()" does the tree construction and predictions. Uncommenting it is enough.

For the SVM (second) part:
Uncomment the bottom-most functions in the svm.py file to run the code.

first_part(): For the first part (figures are drawn with graphviz also)
second_part(): For the second part (figures are drawn with graphviz also)

---
third_part(): For the third part.
third_part_test(100,0.01,"rbf"): For seeing the best result of the classification.
First argument is "C", second is "gamma", and the third is "kernel".
Usage: third_part_test(C, gamma, kernel)
I hardcoded the "third_part_test(100,0.01,"rbf")" function because that was
the best result.

fourth_part(): For the fourth part.
